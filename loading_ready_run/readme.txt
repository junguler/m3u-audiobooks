Founded in 2003 by Graham Stark and Paul Saunders, LoadingReadyRun http://loadingreadyrun.com/ has grown from a sketch comedy site to a comedy destination, with our videos featured in film festivals such as the Comic Con International Film Festival in San Diego, and shown on major TV networks, including G4 TechTV, The CW, TruTV, NBC, and even CNN.

Since 2007, LRR has raised money for the Child's Play charity with the "Desert Bus for Hope" fundraising telethon and gaming marathon. The event, which sees members of the crew play the worst video game ever made for days on end, has raised over $440,000 in its four years.

The LRR Crew fear actual work as they have no transferable skills, so expect the silliness to continue for a great while.
