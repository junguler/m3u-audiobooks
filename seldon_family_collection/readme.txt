Growing up in the 1930's and 40's in New York City, how could Walter Seldon not be a Jazz lover? It was the soundtrack of the city, from Blues to Bebop and beyond. In clubs, at concerts, and on the radio, he listened...and he collected as much of that great music as he could. Though he'd missed the Dixieland Golden Age of 1920's Harlem, it was one of his favorite genres. One of his fondest memories was from 1947 when he attended a recording session of Duke Ellington and his band, then caught a ride back to Ithaca on the band bus. What a thrill that must have been.

Walt was born in 1928 and raised in New York City. In 1944, at the tender age of 16, he earned a Regents Scholarship and attended Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. He took a year off during college, then returned to graduate with the class of 1950 with a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree. During his break from Cornell, Walt worked as an engineer at radio station WALD in Walterboro, SC. On Sundays, Walt would set up for remote transmission from the Christian revival meetings for transmission through the station. In exchange, he was allowed his own Jazz broadcasts for a few hours every Sunday evening. What else he may have done at that station is a mystery.

In the early 1950's, he met the love of his life and soon to be spouse, Delores, at the Music Mart in Baltimore where she worked and he shopped for records. His passion for Dixieland and Big Band was complemented by her enthusiasm for 1950's Jazz. While Walt collected records, the gregarious Jazz loving Delores collected people, bringing Musicians like Dizzy Gillespie, James Moody, roland Hanna, Mike Longo, Mikey Roker, and so many others to the warm elegance of their Bolton Hill home. Music and laughter abounded there among the famous and less famous musicians, all of whom had a place in the capacious hearts of Walt and Delores Seldon.
