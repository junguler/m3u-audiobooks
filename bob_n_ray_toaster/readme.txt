The shows presented here are digitized from the home recorded tapes of dedicated Bob and Ray fans. Some were produced by a person rushing to the radio, pushing the record button and holding a mike near the speaker. Others were taped fully at the time and rerecorded to edit out commercials and such later. One collector used a timer set-up and a direct connection to his tape machine. Fortunately the radio was usually tuned properly when the timer went off. These tape reels were collected and traded over the years.
So on the episodes where a clock ticks and dish washing is clearly heard, please ignore it. Just be thankful someone did record these otherwise lost shows.
If you have a particular favorite episode you would like to hear again, please post a request in the forum. One of us may find and post it.
If you have any BnR materials please upload or contact us. The Toasters can digitize any recording format.
