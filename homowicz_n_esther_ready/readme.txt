This is a unique group of more than 4000 LPs and 78rpm discs, the vast majority pressed in Latin America or the Caribbean. Of special interest are the hundreds of Cuban recordings and more than a thousand Tango discs from Argentina. Of note is the pristine condition of most of the recordings and the many hand-decorated covers that the donor made for 78rpm discs that were originally issued in generic corporate sleeves.

Mr. Chomowicz, who inherited the recordings from a collector friend, and out of respect for the collector and his passion for music, resisted numerous offers to sell the collection. David saw the value to preserve the material for posterity and donated it to The ARChive of Contemporary Music in 2017.

Mr. Chomowicz is a creative professional working in video, print and multimedia in New York City. His design awards and honors include National & Chapter Emmy Awards and numerous awards from The New York Art Directors Club, BDA/Promax, Communication Arts and the AIGA.
