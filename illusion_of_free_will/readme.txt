This audio podcast series presents soundtracks of the pioneering weekly television series, Exploring the Illusion of Free Will. Through dozens of 28-minute episodes, host George Ortega explains why our commonly held notion that we humans have a free will is, upon inspection, quite illusory. The series also describes how we can create a world of far less blame, guilt, arrogance and envy by overcoming this ubiquitous illusion. The original Exploring the Illusion of Free Will television episodes were recorded in the studio of the White Plains, New York Public Access Cable Television Channels (Verizon 45 and Cablevision 76), and premiered on January 6, 2011. All episodes have been dedicated to the public domain, and are immediately available for royalty-free broadcast and distribution over the Internet, and by public access, college, and commercial radio stations anywhere in the world.
